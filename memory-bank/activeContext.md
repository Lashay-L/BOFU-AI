# Active Context - Current Development Focus

## Current Status: ✅ ADMIN DASHBOARD CONTENT BRIEF DISPLAY ISSUE RESOLVED

### Recently Completed
**Admin Dashboard Content Brief Display Fix**
- **Issue:** PlateRanger content brief showed perfectly in user dashboard but appeared empty in admin dashboard
- **Root Cause:** Admin dashboard was incorrectly checking `Object.keys(brief.brief_content).length > 0` on a JSON string instead of parsed object
- **Details:** The database stores `brief_content` as a JSON string, but the admin code was treating it as an already-parsed object
- **Solution:** Added proper JSON parsing logic to correctly detect valid content and pass it to ContentBriefDisplay component
- **Technical Fix:** 
  - Checks if `brief_content` is string (JSON) or object
  - Parses JSON string to verify it contains valid object with keys
  - Passes correct content format to ContentBriefDisplay
- **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED - admin dashboard now displays content briefs correctly

**Content Brief Possible Article Titles Deletion Fix**
- **Issue:** When deleting possible article titles from user dashboard, they were immediately reappearing due to state management conflict
- **Root Cause:** `isProcessingExternalUpdate` flag was incorrectly blocking legitimate user-initiated deletions
- **Solution:** Refined the flag usage to only block updates during JSON content loading, not user interactions
- **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED - deletions now persist correctly

### Primary Development Focus
- **Real-time Collaboration:** Full bidirectional synchronization between admin and user dashboards
- **Content Brief Management:** Enhanced editing and persistence capabilities
- **User Experience:** Ensuring smooth, reliable content editing workflows

### Active Technical Areas
- **Component State Management:** ContentBriefEditorSimple.tsx optimizations
- **Real-time Updates:** Supabase subscription management
- **Data Persistence:** Improved save and update mechanisms

### Immediate Next Steps
1. Test the content brief deletion fix in both dashboards
2. Monitor for any edge cases with the real-time sync
3. Continue with any additional user dashboard improvements

### Technical Context
- **Development Server:** Running on localhost:5175
- **Build Status:** ✅ Successful compilation
- **TypeScript:** ✅ All type errors resolved
